Crework gave me a chance to not only set about learning NLP but also completing my first project. I, along with my team worked on summarisation of lecture transcripts.

From designing the basic prototype to progressing towards the final deployment of the complete project, this program was an action-packed whirlwind of exploring, learning and fun. It has taught me how building within a team of like-minded and passionate people can be an experience in itself.",
